The following WebGL attributes should be used for an optimal post processing workflow:\n\n```js\nimport { WebGLRenderer } from \"three\";\n\nconst renderer = new WebGLRenderer({\n\tpowerPreference: \"high-performance\",\n\tantialias: false,\n\tstencil: false,\n\tdepth: false\n});\n```\n\nThe [EffectComposer](https://pmndrs.github.io/postprocessing/public/docs/class/src/core/EffectComposer.js~EffectComposer.html) manages and runs passes. It is common practice to use a [RenderPass](https://pmndrs.github.io/postprocessing/public/docs/class/src/passes/RenderPass.js~RenderPass.html) as the first pass to automatically clear the buffers and render a scene for further processing. Fullscreen image effects are rendered via the [EffectPass](https://pmndrs.github.io/postprocessing/public/docs/class/src/passes/EffectPass.js~EffectPass.html). Please refer to the [usage example](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/README.md) of three.js for more information on how to setup the renderer, scene and camera.\n\n```js\nimport { BloomEffect, EffectComposer, EffectPass, RenderPass } from \"postprocessing\";\n\nconst composer = new EffectComposer(renderer);\ncomposer.addPass(new RenderPass(scene, camera));\ncomposer.addPass(new EffectPass(camera, new BloomEffect()));\n\nrequestAnimationFrame(function render() {\n\n\trequestAnimationFrame(render);\n\tcomposer.render();\n\n});\n```\n\n## Output Color Space\n\nNew applications should follow a [linear workflow](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LinearRendering-LinearOrGammaWorkflow.html) for color management and postprocessing supports this automatically. Simply set `WebGLRenderer.outputColorSpace` to `SRGBColorSpace` and postprocessing will follow suit.\n\nPostprocessing uses `UnsignedByteType` sRGB frame buffers to store intermediate results. This is a trade-off between hardware support, efficiency and quality since linear results normally require at least 12 bits per color channel to prevent [color degradation and banding](https://blog.demofox.org/2018/03/10/dont-convert-srgb-u8-to-linear-u8/). With low precision sRGB buffers, colors will be clamped to `[0.0, 1.0]` and information loss will shift to the darker spectrum which leads to noticable banding in dark scenes. Linear, high precision `HalfFloatType` buffers don't have these issues and are the preferred option for HDR-like workflows on desktop devices. You can enable high precision frame buffers as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport { HalfFloatType } from \"three\";\n\nconst composer = new EffectComposer(renderer, {\n\tframeBufferType: HalfFloatType\n});\n```\n\n## Tone Mapping\n\nTone mapping is the process of converting HDR colors to LDR output colors. When using postprocessing, the `toneMapping` setting on the renderer should be set to `NoToneMapping` (default) and high precision frame buffers should be enabled. Otherwise, colors will be mapped to `[0.0, 1.0]` at the start of the pipeline. To enable tone mapping, use a `ToneMappingEffect` at the end of the pipeline.\n\nNote that tone mapping is not applied to the clear color when using only the renderer because clearing doesn't involve shaders. Postprocessing applies to the full input image which means that tone mapping will also be applied uniformly. Consequently, the results of tone mapping a clear color background with and without postprocessing will be different, with the postprocessing approach being correct.\n\n## Performance\n\nThis library provides an [EffectPass](https://pmndrs.github.io/postprocessing/public/docs/class/src/passes/EffectPass.js~EffectPass.html) which automatically organizes and merges any given combination of effects. This minimizes the amount of render operations and makes it possible to combine many effects without the performance penalties of traditional pass chaining. Additionally, every effect can choose its own [blend function](https://pmndrs.github.io/postprocessing/public/docs/variable/index.html#static-variable-BlendFunction).\n\nAll fullscreen render operations also use a [single triangle](https://michaldrobot.com/2014/04/01/gcn-execution-patterns-in-full-screen-passes/) that fills the screen. Compared to using a quad, this approach harmonizes with modern GPU rasterization patterns and eliminates unnecessary fragment calculations along the screen diagonal. This is especially beneficial for GPGPU passes and effects that use complex fragment shaders.\n\n[Performance Test](https://pmndrs.github.io/postprocessing/public/demo/#performance)\n\n## Included
