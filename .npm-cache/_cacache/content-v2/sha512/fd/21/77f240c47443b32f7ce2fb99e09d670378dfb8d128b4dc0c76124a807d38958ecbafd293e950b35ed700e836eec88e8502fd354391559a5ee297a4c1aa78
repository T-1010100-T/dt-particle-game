That's not how people use it, and this has caused numerous issues in the past.\n\n## Solution\n\n- A build system for ESM and CJS, compatible with browser, workers, and Node\n- Class based, optimized for tree-shaking, no globals, exports instead of collections\n- Typesafety with simple annotation-like types\n- SemVer and NPM managed dependencies\n\nBut most importantly, allowing more people that use and rely on these primitives to hold a little stake, and to share the weight of maintaining it.\n\n## How to Contribute\n\n1.  Fork and clone the repo\n2.  Run `yarn install` to install dependencies\n3.  Create a branch for your PR with `git checkout -b pr-type/issue-number-your-branch-name beta\n4.  Let's get cooking! 👨🏻‍🍳🥓\n\n### Commit Guidelines\n\nBe sure your commit messages follow this specification: https://conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4\n\n## Publishing\n\nWe use `semantic-release-action` to deploy the package. Because of this only certain commits will trigger the action of creating a release:\n\n- `chore` will not release a new version\n- `fix:` will create a `0.0.x` version\n- `feat:` will create a `0.x.0` version\n- `BREAKING CHANGE:` will create a `x.0.0`
